# Prolog

Prolog program to:
1.  Compute the length of a given list (program handles lists of various sizes).
2.  Compute the second to last element of a given list. (program handles lists of various sizes and program deals with lists     containing lists as elements).
3.  Take two lists,L1 and L2, of same lengths and will return a merged list,L3, such that L3 is obtained by carrying out the perfect shuffle operation on L1 and L2.  (program handles lists of various sizes).  (Note:  A perfect shuffle on two lists, [1, 2] and [3, 4], will result in [1, 3, 2, 4].)
4.  Reversing the list
5.  Creating a new list after deleting list 2 from list 1
6.  Prefix of two lists . (e.g. [1,2,3],[a,b,c] -> [a,b,c,1,2,3])
7.  suffix of two lists. (e.g.[1,2,3],[a,b,c] -> [1,2,3,a,b,c] )
8.  Comparison and analysis of CLisp and Prolog versions.
